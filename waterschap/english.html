<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is a guide to the election on 15 March 2023, written for people
who moved to the Netherlands in 2022.</p>
<p>Whether or not you plan to stay in the Netherlands, you have the
right to shape the country’s future by voting in this election. But this
may be the first time you have even heard of a water board, and it’s
even possible this is the first chance in your life to vote.</p>
<p>This booklet will try to explain what water boards are, what they do,
and why they are worth voting for. It will tell you how the electoral
system works and give practical instructions on how to cast your actual
ballot. It will invite you to consider a few topics of debate, and gives
the location of an interactive questionnaire which can help you decide
how to vote.</p>
<p>Much of the information contained in this booklet is adapted from
material published originally in Dutch by the Union of Water Boards and
the Dutch national government. It is published in Ukrainian, Russian and
English by Benjamin Goodger of Amersfoort.</p>
</section>
<section id="water-boards" class="level1">
<h1>Water boards</h1>
<p>Water boards (Dutch: <span lang="nl">waterschappen</span>) are the
part of the state that is responsible for management of water in the
Netherlands. This is a big job in this country in particular. The
Netherlands is formed mostly of a single enormous river delta with a
quarter of a million kilometres of waterways. After a millennium of land
reclamation and drainage projects, over 50% of the country is less than
a metre above sea level. The Dutch say, “God created the world, then we
created the Netherlands.”</p>
<p>Starting in the 1200s, democratic institutions were entrusted to keep
the sea and rivers in check. Now the entire country is divided into 21
water boards, and they maintain dams and dikes that stretch for a total
of 18,000 kilometres. They are also responsible for sewage treatment,
but they don’t supply drinking water to our homes.</p>
<section id="governance-and-funding" class="level2">
<h2>Governance and funding</h2>
<p>The structure of a water board mirrors that of a Dutch municipality
(<span lang="nl">gemeente</span>). Each water board has a general
council, an executive team chosen from that council, and a chairperson
(equivalent to a mayor) who is appointed by the national government. The
chairperson has the residual title of <span
lang="nl">“dijkgraaf”,</span> meaning “earl of dikes.”</p>
<p>The composition of the general council tries to balance the needs of
the general population, farmers, businesses and Nature. In the case of
the <span lang="nl">Vallei en Veluwe</span> water board, which contains
Amersfoort, the 30-member council has 23 members elected by the
residents of the area. The other seven seats are “reserved” for interest
groups of farmers, businesses, and nature organisations.</p>
<p>In contrast to municipalities, water boards do not routinely take
grants from the national government. Instead they directly tax each
household and business in their area. The amount of tax paid depends
partly on the amount of sewage produced.</p>
</section>
<section id="politics-of-water" class="level2">
<h2>Politics of water</h2>
<p>Every water board has problems unique to the territory that it
controls. But they all have to deal with problems that affect the
Netherlands as a whole, or all of Europe, or the whole world.</p>
<p>Europe now experiences extreme weather on an annual basis. You
probably remember last summer’s drought, but the summer of 2021 brought
deadly flooding to several countries. The damage to the Netherlands was
over €1.2 billion with no fatalities, whereas just over the border in
Germany, the same flood killed 196 people.</p>
<p>Such tragedies of course show the exceptional competence of Dutch
emergency management, but they also show how vital it is to ensure that
flood defences are properly designed and maintained. In other words,
people need to be sure that the water boards are doing their job
properly because corruption, negligence and apathy are all deadly.</p>
<p>There has not been a devastating flood in the Netherlands for seventy
years, in part because of massive investment in flood defences in the
last century. But the sea level is rising and patterns of rainfall are
becoming less predictable. At the same time, there is an urgent need for
new housing and an increasingly difficult conversation about water
pollution.</p>
<p>Do we need higher, stronger, costlier dikes? Should land be set aside
for the water? Can we build houses wherever we like? What’s more
important, agricultural jobs or clean water? Should we invest now, or
wait to see where investment is most badly needed? And should we spend
money on improving access to water-based recreation? These are all
questions that water boards have to answer.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-vote" class="level2">
<h2>Why vote?</h2>
<p>You don’t have to vote. But you should, if you want to.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="rules-of-the-election" class="level1">
<h1>Rules of the election</h1>
<p>The Dutch electoral system has several important properties designed
to make it free and fair, meaning that elections produce results that
accurately reflect the genuine wishes of every eligible voter.</p>
<p>Every voter gets one vote. Trying to vote more than once in the same
election is a serious crime. The <span lang="nl">stempas</span> is a
single-use document that proves to election workers that you haven’t
already voted at a different polling station.</p>
<p>Voting is no longer compulsory.</p>
<section id="eligibility" class="level2">
<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>There are actually two elections scheduled in the European part of
the Netherlands on 15 March 2023. (And there are two more elections in
the Caribbean Netherlands on the same date). The other election
happening here is for the provincial councils, and voters must have
Dutch nationality to vote in it.</p>
<p>Voting for the water board is open to all adults living legally in
the Netherlands. If you are a refugee of the Russo-Ukrainian war, you
count as a legal resident. So, to vote, your date of birth must be 15
March 2005 or earlier and you must be registered in the BRP
database.</p>
<p>You can only vote for your own water board – that’s the one which
contains your registered home address (in the BRP database) on 30
January.</p>
<p>Some people are banned from voting in the Netherlands. But this can
only happen to someone who is convicted of specific serious crimes. You
would know if it had happened to you (and you would be in prison).</p>
</section>
<section id="electoral-mathematics" class="level2">
<h2>Electoral mathematics</h2>
<p>Dutch elections use what’s known as multiple-winner proportional
representation with open party lists – the same system used to elect
half the members of the Ukrainian parliament in 2019.</p>
<p>Multiple-winner means that the vote is expected to produce more than
one winning candidate. In the case of the <span lang="nl">Vallei en
Veluwe</span> water board election, this number is 23. Each of the 23
winners needs the same proportion of overall votes (about 4.4% in our
example).</p>
<p>Each vote is for a candidate, not for a party. But a lot of “extra”
votes are left over when a candidate gets more than 4.4%, or not enough
to win. Those votes will effectively go to the party. The list ordering
determines which candidates get the extra votes.</p>
<p>This arrangement means that the proportion of winners from each party
will very closely reflect the proportion of votes for the parties’
candidates, even if the individual candidates receive very different
numbers of votes.</p>
<p>If you want to vote for a party and don’t particularly care about the
candidates (the majority opinion), then you can choose to simply vote
for the first candidate from your chosen party. Some people prefer to
vote for the first woman or the first man on the list. Or you could vote
for a specific candidate that you like, even if that candidate has
little chance of winning. In neither case is your vote wasted.</p>
<p>Independent candidates are permitted and are treated like the only
candidate in a party of one.</p>
</section>
<section id="privacy" class="level2">
<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>Your vote is private. Election workers, police officers, party
officials, your parents, siblings, spouse, children, employer, landlord
– all remain ignorant of the way you voted. You are perfectly free to
tell anyone how you voted, but they have no way to check. It’s the only
way to ensure you feel safe voting the way you really want.</p>
<p>Photography and video recording are not permitted inside the polling
station for this reason.</p>
<p>The only record is that you received a ballot. The ballot itself is
completely anonymous, designed to show exactly one vote and nothing
else. It must not be signed, annotated or otherwise marked in any way,
or it will be rejected during the count.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="before-the-election" class="level1">
<h1>Before the election</h1>
<p>Besides deciding how to vote (<a href="#choosing-how-to-vote">see
below</a>), preparing for the election is very simple for almost
everyone.</p>
<section id="the-invitation" class="level2">
<h2>The invitation</h2>
<p>If you are eligible to vote, you should receive an A5 postcard
labelled <span lang="nl">“STEMPAS”</span> before the end of February.
This is your invitation to vote. It has your name and address, basic
information about the election, and a number of security features. On
the back is a form you can fill in if you need someone else to vote in
your place (<a href="#proxy-voting">see below</a>).</p>
<p>Don’t throw the stempas away! You will need it to vote. If it is lost
or damaged, you can get a new one by visiting your city hall before noon
on 14 March (the day before the election).</p>
</section>
<section id="the-candidate-list" class="level2">
<h2>The candidate list</h2>
<p>Shortly after the invitation, you should receive a list of the
candidates in your area. The list is very similar to the real ballot: a
large folded paper with candidates (possibly hundreds of them) arranged
in columns, one column per party. The party’s name is at the top. Then
each candidate is listed, like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="candidate.svg" style="height:6em" /><span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="marginnote"> The author as the eighth candidate in a hypothetical
list.<br />
<br />
</span></span>
</figure>
<p>The candidate’s family name is printed in bold, opposite their
position in their party’s list of candidates. Below that are the
candidate’s initials and their name (possibly a nickname, so the initial
doesn’t necessarily match). An m or v then indicates that the candidate
is male or female, respectively. Finally, the candidate’s city of
residence is printed at the bottom right.</p>
<p>There are no party logos, photographs, messages to the voter, or
descriptions of the candidates. It is considered impossible to ensure
the objectivity of such material, so it cannot be included in official
documents.</p>
</section>
<section id="polling-stations" class="level2">
<h2>Polling stations</h2>
<p>It’s a good idea to choose a polling station in advance. Almost
certainly you can find one within walking distance of your home. Your
<span lang="nl">stempas</span> will give the addresses of several of
them, but (depending on where you live) you may have more options. You
can choose the most convenient – for example, one that is between your
home and workplace.</p>
<p>Most polling stations will open at 7:30 and close at 21:00, but some
have different hours.</p>
<p>Your chosen polling station must be situated within your own water
board area. And, unless you specially arrange otherwise (<a
href="#voting-in-another-municipality">see below</a>), it must be within
your own municipality.</p>
<p>The website <a href="waarismijnstemlokaal.nl">Waar is Mijn
Stemlokaal</a> (“Where is my polling station?”) is an interactive map
that shows the locations of every polling station in the Netherlands.
But the map is not complete until about a week before the election.</p>
</section>
<section id="identification" class="level2">
<h2>Identification</h2>
<p>In addition to the <span lang="nl">stempas</span>, you must show
photographic ID to vote. Specifically, you will need your passport, with
the sticker or card from the IND that certifies your legal residence in
the Netherlands.</p>
<p>If you happen to have an EU/EEA driving licence (Dutch, Polish, etc)
then you can identify yourself with that instead of your passport.</p>
<p>Your identity document must not be more than five years out of date.
That is, it must be valid until at least 16 March 2018.</p>
</section>
<section id="proxy-voting" class="level2">
<h2>Proxy voting</h2>
<p>If you can’t vote in person (for example because you will be in
Ukraine on 15 March), you can get someone you trust to vote on your
behalf. That person must also be eligible to vote, have appropriate
identification, and live in the same municipality.</p>
<p>The simplest way to authorize a proxy to vote for you is to complete
the form on the back of the <span lang="nl">stempas</span>. You can then
give the <span lang="nl">stempas</span> to your proxy and they can vote
for you. They must show a copy of your passport and IND document – a
photo on their phone is OK if everything is clearly readable.</p>
<p>Any one person is limited to cast two proxy votes per election.</p>
<p>The government points out that it is illegal to ask someone to let
you vote in their place. This is considered voter fraud and is
punishable by imprisonment. If someone asks to buy your vote, report it
to the police.</p>
</section>
<section id="voting-in-another-municipality" class="level2">
<h2>Voting in another municipality</h2>
<p>It’s almost always more convenient to vote in your own municipality.
But if you really need to vote somewhere else, you can vote in another
municipality. You can still only vote at a polling station located
within your water board’s area.</p>
<p>You can do this by filling in a form and mailing it to your own
municipality, or more simply by visiting the city hall before noon on 14
March. They will exchange your <span lang="nl">stempas</span> for a
<span lang="nl">“kiezerspas”</span>, which serves the same purpose but
can be used in another municipality. This is free of charge.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="choosing-how-to-vote" class="level1">
<h1>Choosing how to vote</h1>
<p>You probably know very little about Dutch political parties,
especially those that provide candidates in <span
lang="nl">waterschap</span> elections. You’re not alone in that.
Fortunately, the website <a href="https://mijnstem.nl" lang="nl">Mijn
Stem</a> (“My Vote”) is available to provide advice on what party best
matches your views.</p>
<p><span lang="nl">Mijn Stem</span> is a collaboration between DPG Media
Group (which, among other things, owns the newspaper <span lang="nl">De
Volkskrant</span>) and Citisens, a company that does market research but
specialises in helping public agencies to improve political engagement.
All parties participate in it.</p>
<p>Please note that, while <span lang="nl">Mijn Stem</span> is usually
considered independent and impartial, this cannot be absolutely
guaranteed. Once it has made its recommendation, you should review the
party’s manifesto to check that you actually agree with it.</p>
<p>The rest of this section is a walkthrough of the questionnaire.</p>
<section id="using-mijn-stem" class="level2">
<h2>Using <span lang="nl">Mijn Stem</span></h2>
<p>When you open MS, you will be asked which election you need advice
for. Click “Waterschappen”.</p>
<p>You will then be asked for your postcode so that the website can find
which waterschap you are voting for. Enter it and click “Check”. After a
moment, a new button will appear with the name of your waterschap, so
click that.</p>
<p>Once the title screen for the questionnaire has loaded, you can
choose to switch language to English using the button at the top-right
corner. If you don’t read English, you’ll need to enable your web
browser’s translation function.</p>
<p>Several questions have highlighted sections that you can click to get
an explanation of terminology.</p>
<p>For each question, indicate your opinion by dragging the slider left
or right. You have to move it at least slightly to continue, but you
don’t have to move it all the way in either direction. Note that the
position of the answers does not signify whether they are politically
left- or right-wing answers.</p>
<p>Once you have given an opinion, you can click the button to read
manufesto extracts on the topic at hand.</p>
<p>Once you have answered all the questions, you will be asked for your
postcode again. You don’t have to answer this. If you do, your opinions
will be anonymously added to the researchers’ database. You are also
asked for your email address and whether you would like to be asked to
participate in future surveys – “Nee” is the Dutch word for “No.”
Finally, tick the box that says you agree with the privacy statement and
click “Volgende” once more.</p>
<p>The results screen is a list of all the parties running in the
election in your area, with the best matches at the top. It shows with a
percentage how much it thinks your opinion matches that of the party.
You can click any of the parties to see how your answer compares to the
party’s for each question.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="how-to-cast-your-vote" class="level1">
<h1>How to cast your vote</h1>
<figure>
<img src="winterswijk.jpg" /> <span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="marginnote"> Signage outside a polling station in 2022.<br />
<br />
</span></span>
</figure>
<p>Your polling station should be easy to find. They are usually
community halls, places of worship, or libraries – in any case, a large
public building. Temporary signage is placed from a considerable
distance.</p>
<p>You can bring your child or other non-voters to the polling station,
although they aren’t allowed in the voting booth.</p>
<figure>
<img src="polling-station.jpg" /> <span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="marginnote"> A polling station in 2015.<br />
<br />
</span></span>
</figure>
<p>When you arrive, you should see a table with several officials (there
may be a small queue). Give one of them your <span
lang="nl">stempas</span> (or <span lang="nl">kiezerspas</span>) and
ID.</p>
<p>The official will check that everything matches up. This may take a
couple of minutes and may involve discussion with a colleague, so don’t
be alarmed if it takes longer than you expect. They will then give you
back your ID and a ballot. They keep the <span lang="nl">stempas</span>.
You may also be given a red pencil at this point, or you will find one
inside the voting booth. Go into the voting booth alone.</p>
<p>Unfold the ballot, locate your preferred candidate, and use the
pencil to fill in the circle next to their name. Do not mark the ballot
in any other way.</p>
<p>The Electoral Council would prefer that you refrain from taking a
selfie with your ballot. However, it is legal to do so.</p>
<p>Fold up the ballot again (preferably the same way it was folded
originally, but this is not very important) and leave the voting
booth.</p>
<p>If you have made some kind of mistake, or have changed your mind,
then at this point you can return the ballot to a worker for destruction
and receive a fresh ballot. You can only do this once.</p>
<p>When you are happy with your ballot, you will need to find the right
box for it. You should see two or more boxes labelled something like
<span lang="nl">“WATERSCHAP”</span> and <span
lang="nl">“PROVINCIE”</span> – the former is for your ballot, the latter
is for ballots in the provincial election. Place the ballot in the box
and return your pencil if applicable.</p>
<figure>
<img src="ballot-boxes.jpg" /> <span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="marginnote"> Ballot boxes for two simultaneous elections in
2015.<br />
<br />
</span></span>
</figure>
<p>You can then leave the polling station immediately. Congratulations –
you have just voted in the Netherlands for the first time.</p>
